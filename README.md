# AssetSuite
## Overview
A simple and convinient library for loading game assets (like images and meshes) from disc to local memory.It's main design principle is that it has to be both convinient to use and easy to read and understand, and not necessarily extremly fast. You should use this library if you simply want to get your work done on your engine and don't care about the details, or if you are studying image formats like BMP or PNG.

## Dependencies
The library requires C++17 because it uses the `filesystem` header. It also requires C++20 because of the `span` usage.
